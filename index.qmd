## Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome splash page! Provide an overview of the book.

Sample evaluation of R and Python in a side-by-side manner:

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
#### R

```{r}
my_list = list(1, 2, 3)
typeof(my_list)
```

#### Python

```{python}
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
type(my_list)
```

## Figures and cross referencing

You can cross reference figures and tables easily. See for example @fig-myPlot. You can also cross reference chapters, for example like [this](#sec-hello-world).

```{r fig-myPlot}
#| fig-cap: "This is a figure caption"
#| echo: false
plot(cars)
```

For adding reference, quarto work great with Zotero. If you are in RStudio, just type \\@ and you will be able to search your Zotero library. When you add a reference, it will automatically be added to the `references.bib` file. Here's a reference to a paper [@arvesen2018].

For general Quarto help, see [here](#0){style="font-size: 11pt;"}.
